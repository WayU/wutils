## wUtils
Minecraft Fabric Clientside mod
Made for educational purposes :D

### Features
Code is bad and unoptimized, but this is my first project so forgive :)

- Aim Assist
- AutoFish (Propably can't be disabled and is badly made.)
- Triggerbot (works somehow)

### How to use
Put in ur fabric mods folder. Keybinds are in the minecraft settings.

### License

This project is available under the CC0 license.
Half of the project is copied anyways so idk if the license really matters
